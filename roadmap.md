# Roadmap 

## Add ability to create pages programatically

  - Have page URLS for: city, stata, artist, venue
  - URL structure: 
    /artist/kaskade
    /california/san-diego
    /california/san-diego/venue-name

  ### Possible Approaches: 

  Next.JS Server side rendering with dynamic routes 
  Node JS - need to research ways
  Change Front End to React - not really needed right now, but would be cool 
  Database - can use to store API info from different sources 
  Database-  will need for login to hold user info

  ### Integrate more API's

  - research Ticket Master, Live Nation, Comedy Clubs too? 


## Add social media interaction ability
  - ability to like venues / artists
  - ability to share
